## Installation

### 1. Install the Extension

Clone this repository into your ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ShmuelRonen/ComfyUI-Orpheus-TTS.git
```

### 2. Install Required Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch numpy soundfile transformers huggingface_hub nltk snac
```

### 3. Install SoX (Required for Audio Effects)

#### Windows

1. Download SoX for Windows from the [official SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/14.4.2/)
   - Download the `.exe` installer (e.g., `sox-14.4.2-win32.exe`)

2. Run the installer:
   - Follow the installation prompts
   - **Important**: Note the installation directory (default is usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\sox-14-4-2\`)
   
3. No need to add to PATH - the extension uses the direct path to SoX

#### WSL 2 (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sox
```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install sox
```

### 4. Restart ComfyUI

After installing all required components, restart ComfyUI to load the extension.

## Configuration

### Hugging Face Authentication (Optional)

To access private models on Hugging Face, create a file named `hf_config.json` in the extension directory and insert your HF Token KEY:

   ```json
   {
     "token": "YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN_HERE"
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart ComfyUI

Your token will be used to authenticate with Hugging Face when downloading models. This is only required if you're using private models or if you need higher rate limits.

## Nodes

### Orpheus TTS Model Loader

Loads the required models for Orpheus TTS.

**Inputs:**
- `snac_model_path` (optional): Path to SNAC model (default: "hubertsiuzdak/snac_24khz")
- `orpheus_model_path` (optional): Path to Orpheus model (default: "canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft")

**Outputs:**
- `model`: Model reference to be passed to the generate node

  ## Paralinguistic Elements

You can add expressive elements to the speech by inserting these tags:

- **`<laugh>`** - Natural laughter
- **`<chuckle>`** - Light, subtle laughter
- **`<sigh>`** - Exhaling with emotion
- **`<cough>`** - Clearing throat
- **`<sniffle>`** - Subtle nasal sound
- **`<groan>`** - Low, grumbling sound
- **`<yawn>`** - Tired exhale
- **`<gasp>`** - Sudden intake of breath

### Example:
```
I can't believe it! <laugh> That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.
<sigh> But now I need to get back to work.
```

## Audio Effect Tips

### Volume Control

- **Gain Control**: Use `gain_db` to increase or decrease volume without distortion
  - Positive values (0 to +20 dB): Increase volume with automatic clipping prevention
  - Negative values (-20 to 0 dB): Decrease volume
  - For best results with multiple effects, set gain last in your workflow

- **Normalization**: Enable `normalize_audio` to automatically balance levels
  - Great for ensuring consistent volume across different voice samples
  - Applied before other effects for best results

### Reverb

Reverb adds a sense of space to your audio. Here are some suggested settings:

- **Small Room**: reverb_amount = 20, reverb_room_scale = 25
- **Medium Room**: reverb_amount = 40, reverb_room_scale = 50
- **Large Hall**: reverb_amount = 70, reverb_room_scale = 80
- **Cathedral**: reverb_amount = 90, reverb_room_scale = 95

### Echo

Echo creates repeating sound reflections. Good settings to try:

- **Subtle Echo**: echo_delay = 0.3, echo_decay = 0.3
- **Moderate Echo**: echo_delay = 0.5, echo_decay = 0.5
- **Canyon Echo**: echo_delay = 1.0, echo_decay = 0.7

### Effect Combinations

- **Phone Call**: pitch_shift = 0, speed_factor = 1.0, add_reverb = True, reverb_amount = 10, reverb_room_scale = 10
- **Radio Announcer**: pitch_shift = -2, speed_factor = 0.9, add_reverb = True, reverb_amount = 20, gain_db = 3
- **Stadium Announcement**: pitch_shift = 0, speed_factor = 1.0, add_reverb = True, reverb_amount = 60, add_echo = True, echo_delay = 0.8
- **Child Voice**: pitch_shift = 4, speed_factor = 1.1, gain_db = 2
- **Deep Voice**: pitch_shift = -4, speed_factor = 0.9, gain_db = -2

## Paralinguistic Elements

You can add expressive elements to the speech by inserting these tags:

- **`<laugh>`** - Natural laughter
- **`<chuckle>`** - Light, subtle laughter
- **`<sigh>`** - Exhaling with emotion
- **`<cough>`** - Clearing throat
- **`<sniffle>`** - Subtle nasal sound
- **`<groan>`** - Low, grumbling sound
- **`<yawn>`** - Tired exhale
- **`<gasp>`** - Sudden intake of breath

### Example:
```
I can't believe it! <laugh> That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.
<sigh> But now I need to get back to work.
```

## SoX Troubleshooting

### Windows

If you encounter issues with SoX:

1. Verify the SoX path in the "Orpheus Audio Effects" node:
   - Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\sox-14-4-2\sox.exe`
   - If your installation is in a different location, provide the full path to sox.exe

2. Check if SoX is installed correctly:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Run `"C:\Program Files (x86)\sox-14-4-2\sox.exe" --version`
   - If you get an error, reinstall SoX

### WSL 2 (Ubuntu)

1. Verify SoX installation:
   ```bash
   sox --version
   ```

2. If SoX is not found, install it:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install sox
   ```
